*# The problem Medical Cost Prognosis: Bed and Procedure Analys solves*

• Unavailability of critical emergency information like availability of beds, PPE kits, etc

• Non-Transparency of Medical Rates & their subdivisions

• Emergency facilities system

• Exploitation of Patients by Overcharging .

*# Challenges we ran into*

• A National Information Portal where critical information like Availability of Beds, Oxygen, etc will be updated regularly.

• Cost Estimator to Estimate cost for Surgery at a specific hospital to have transparency of rates.

• Hospitals can update manually on regular basis or they can use the Near Real-Time update module to update the availability of beds automatically.

• Users can calculate the estimated cost for a specific surgery at a specific hospital to check if he is been overcharged.

• The patient can fill out a Grievances form to file a complaint against hospitals directly to District medical council.

• Creating Statistical Report based on all the Data fetched from feedback form and grievances form.
